# Mouse-Jiggle
Needed something to stop the work computer from going into sleep mode

Used a Seeed Xiao, a push button, some wire and a 10k 1/4w resistor.  Plug in, wait for Window's to see the "mouse" then press the button. You should see the mouse "jiggle" on the screen and very slowly move its way to the top. I've tested this at work and it seems to do the job.
I am using a cable as I cant find a suitable adaptor.
